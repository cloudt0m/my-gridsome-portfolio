  The website is a renewal of old one. The old version of the site was not easy to use, and designed in old resolution specification.<br />
  Now the website is more fashion, more user friendly, by redesigned in modern visual language and reconstructing the site structure.
  I participated in the site from UI stage, to HTML / SCSS / JS development. Now it is transcribed to razor and work with dotnet framework.
